"""LLaMA 3 3B models (like Llama_3_2_3B_Instruct) are small models with only 3 billion parameters, which limits their reasoning and instruction-following capabilities compared to larger models (like 7B, 13B, or 70B).

Smaller models may fail to consistently follow complex instructions, especially when the prompt requires multi-step reasoning, nuanced understanding, or holding long-term context."""


ü¶ô LLaMA 3 (3B) Instruct with LangChain Memory
This notebook demonstrates how to add conversational memory to a local LLaMA 3 (3B) Instruct model using LangChain's memory modules, specifically ConversationBufferMemory.

üìò What This Notebook Covers
Loading the LLaMA 3 (3B) Instruct model locally using Hugging Face Transformers.

Integrating memory into the chatbot using LangChain to maintain conversation history.

Using ConversationBufferMemory to provide context-aware answers.

Running and testing conversational prompts to see how memory influences responses.

Managing GPU memory and addressing potential CUDA out of memory issues, especially on platforms like Google Colab.

üìÅ Files

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Python 3.9+

transformers

langchain

accelerate

torch

xformers (optional for memory efficiency)

GPU (optional but recommended)

üöÄ How to Run
Install required packages via pip.

Run the cells sequentially in a GPU-enabled environment.

Observe how the model handles memory through multiple turns of conversation.

üß† Memory Module
We specifically use:

python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
This module stores the entire conversation history in a buffer, allowing the model to generate more coherent multi-turn responses.

üîß Notes
Designed for local experimentation with models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, but a smaller 3B version is used to fit Colab/GPU constraints.

Consider reducing context size or using model quantization if you encounter memory issues.
