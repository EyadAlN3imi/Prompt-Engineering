ü¶ô LLaMA 3 (3B) Instruct with LangChain Memory
This notebook demonstrates how to add conversational memory to a local LLaMA 3 (3B) Instruct model using LangChain's memory modules, specifically ConversationBufferMemory.

üìò What This Notebook Covers
Loading the LLaMA 3 (3B) Instruct model locally using Hugging Face Transformers.

Integrating memory into the chatbot using LangChain to maintain conversation history.

Using ConversationBufferMemory to provide context-aware answers.

Running and testing conversational prompts to see how memory influences responses.

Managing GPU memory and addressing potential CUDA out of memory issues, especially on platforms like Google Colab.

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Python 3.9+

transformers

langchain

accelerate

torch

xformers (optional for memory efficiency)

GPU (optional but recommended)

üöÄ How to Run
Install required packages via pip.

Run the cells sequentially in a GPU-enabled environment.

Observe how the model handles memory through multiple turns of conversation.

üß† Memory Module
We specifically use:

python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
This module stores the entire conversation history in a buffer, allowing the model to generate more coherent multi-turn responses.

üîß Notes
Designed for local experimentation with models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, but a smaller 3B version is used to fit Colab/GPU constraints.

Consider reducing context size or using model quantization if you encounter memory issues.
